    <h1>Is Finex Properly Licensed in Hong Kong?</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Finex has been actively marketing investment products to Korean investors, often emphasizing overseas opportunities. However, recent public inquiries have raised questions regarding the regulatory status of Finex, particularly in Hong Kong, where many asset management firms are licensed under the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).</p>

    <h2>What Does the SFC Registry Say?</h2>
    <p>As of June 2025, a search on the official <strong>Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong</strong> website did not return any licensed entity named "Finex" under <strong>Type 9 (Asset Management)</strong> or <strong>Type 1 (Dealing in Securities)</strong>.</p>
    <p>While this does not necessarily imply wrongdoing, it may raise concerns about the legal structure under which Finex is operating and whether it is authorized to offer investment products in or from Hong Kong.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters to Korean Investors</h2>
    <p>Several Korean investors have expressed confusion over the jurisdiction and licensing of Finex’s offerings. If a financial company is soliciting capital across borders, especially from retail or high-net-worth individuals, <strong>regulatory clarity is crucial</strong> for investor protection.</p>
    <p>In the past, Hong Kong's SFC has taken strong enforcement actions against unlicensed financial promotion to overseas investors.</p>

    <h2>Is Finex Operating Through a Third-Party Platform?</h2>
    <p>According to social media reports and local investor forums, some believe that Finex may be partnering with <strong>third-party custodians or marketing agents</strong> to distribute its products. However, no public disclosures or confirmations have been made by the company regarding its exact legal setup or licensing footprint.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>At the time of writing, it remains unclear whether Finex is operating with proper regulatory approvals in Hong Kong or other jurisdictions.</p>
    <p>Investors are advised to <strong>conduct independent due diligence</strong> and consult with legal professionals before engaging in any overseas investment scheme. When in doubt, verifying a company’s status through official financial regulators like the SFC is a prudent first step.</p>
